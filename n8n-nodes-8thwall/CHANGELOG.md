## 1.0.1 — 2025-09-27

Router node added.

- New node: “8th Wall MCP Router” that maps free‑text requests into tool + args items (e.g., scaffold, start dev server, download/add model, set background color, add primitives/lights, environment HDR, OrbitControls/Grid/Floor).

- Uses n8n `httpRequest` helper; supports `continueOnFail`
- Credential: “8th Wall MCP Bridge API” with Test request (`GET /tools`)
- Build: TypeScript compile + asset copy (SVG icon) on prepack
- Packaging: files whitelist (`dist`, `README.md`), public publish config
